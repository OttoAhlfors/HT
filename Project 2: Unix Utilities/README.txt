This file contains the instructions to running and testing the program(s) in this assignment

Project 2: Unix Utilities
In project 2 I have made two programs 'my-cat' and 'my-grep' both of these have their own code in their respective '.c' files
and can be compiled using the gcc compiler command 'gcc my-cat.c -o my-cat' and 'gcc my-grep.c -o my-grep'.
These commands compile the programs into a format that can be ran in an Ubuntu environment with the commands './my-cat' and './my-grep'.
These commands will not run the program properly though, for me-cat.
You can use the text.txt file for testing with the commands './my-cat text' and './my-grep searchterm text.txt'.

This project was made and tested in a virtual Ubuntu environment.
