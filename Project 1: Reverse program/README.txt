This file contains the instructions to running and testing the program(s) in this assignment

Project 1: Warmup to C and Unix programming
In project 1 I have made a single program called 'reverse' all the code for this program can be found in the reverse.c file.
It has been compiled with the command 'gcc reverse.c -o reverse' in to a file that can be ran with Ubuntu by using the command './reverse'.
This will not run the program the way it should be used tho, it can be used properly with './reverse filename_you_want_to_copy_from filename_you_want_to_copy_to'.
With the included test files this command would be './reverse inputTest.txt outputTest.txt'.

This project was made and tested in a virtual Ubuntu environment.
